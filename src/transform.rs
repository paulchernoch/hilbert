    ///   1. It is **invertible**. Performing the transform of a Hilbert index to a vector then the reverse transform should
    ///      yield the original index.
    ///   2. It is **exhaustive**. Every possible Hilbert Index is visited, from zero to 2^(Bits*Dimensions) - 1
    ///   3. It takes **baby steps**. Each consecutive vector yielded by increasing the Hilbert Index by one 
    ///      should differ from the previous vector in a single dimension, and the change in coordinate value 
    ///      should only be +1 or -1.
    ///   4. It is **twisty**. The dimension that changes in one iteration should _seldom_ match the dimension 
    ///      that changed in the immediately previous iteration. In rare instances, I have seen it move the same 
    ///      direction three times in a row. I do not know if it ever moves farther than that in the same direction
